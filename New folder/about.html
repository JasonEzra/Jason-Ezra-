This website is created to submit for a web development competition. This website is created solely by 
Jason Ezra, student of class 12 without any help from others.
And I declare the work is truly original without plagiarism. I have created this with the knowledge acquired. 
And I am thankful to my parents, teachers, and school for their support and permission and to my friends who 
informed about this competition and encouraged me to participate.
